Coregistration options
*****************************

This section provides information about the arguments that can be
passed to `mdreg.fit` to control the coregistration process. These arguments 
are provided as a dictionary referred to as `fit_coreg` in the `mdreg.fit` 
function.

By default, `mdreg` uses the `elastix` package for coregistration, with default
parameters. The options allow the user to control the coregistration package 
used, and the optional parameters which can be controlled within the 
different packages.


Elastix
-------

Elastix is one of the coregistration engines available to perform 
the coregistration components in `mdreg`. For consistent usage  
across different coregistration engines, `mdreg` contains pythonic wrappers 
for the core functionality available in elastix, but the functionality is 
not otherwise modified. 

We refer to the original 
`elastix pages <https://github.com/SuperElastix>`_ 
for more detail on elastix. Please note elastix authors request that the 
following papers are cited if you use the elastix software anywhere:

`mdreg` uses the interface `itk-elastix` which is based on SimpleElastix, 
created by Kasper Marstal:
