Fitting options
*****************************

This section provides information about the arguments required for the 
`fit_image` dictionary in the `mdreg` package. The `fit_image` dictionary is used 
to fit a model to image data, and the arguments specified in the dictionary 
control various aspects of the fitting process. 

All that is needed in order to create a custom function and use it inside mdreg
is to wrap it into a function that takes the image array as argument, and 
returns the fit to the model and the fitted model parameters. Use the format of
functions in the :ref:`models` module as a guide.
